# Data Science - King County Housing Price Estimator
## Overview
* A tool to estimate the home prices (MAE ~ 75,000) in King County, WA to help home buyers negotiate  
* Dataset of 21,613 King County homes sold between May 2014 - May 2015 obtained from Kaggle
* Looked into many different approaches including Linear, Lasso, Random Forest and XGBoost regressors to find best MAE
* Optimized Random Forest and XGBoost regressors to reach the optimal model with an accuracy of 96%
* Built and integrated model into restful API using Flask

## Project Walkthough
This is my second data science project following the same youtube walkthrough. Huge shout out to Ken Jee for simplifying the data science process as well as providing a vast amount of insight on the projects Data Scientists work on: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t

## Cleaning the Data
Dataset taken from Kaggle did not need much cleaing. Only removed trailing zeros from some columns to increase legibility.

## EDA
Examining distributions of the data, it was interesting to see the correlations between home attributes and price. Here are some hightlights.

## Building the Models
A train-test split of 80/20 was used for all the models in this project. (Train:80%, Test:20%)

I looked at four different models to see how each one performed and which performed best. All models were also evaluated using MAE(mean absolute error), this model validation is ideal for looking at home prices.

Four differnet models used:
* Multiple linear regression - Used as a baseline.
* Lasso regression - Explored for any sparse data.
* Random Forest regression - Classification works well for this type of data.
* XGBoost regression - Very powerful gradient booster to compare to the other models.

## Performance of Models
XGBoost performed the best of the four.
* **XGBoost**: MAE - $74,975
* **Random Forest**: MAE - $92,354
* **Lasso Regression**: MAE - $145,252
* **Linear Regression**: MAE - $145,252

# Productionization using Flask
I finally built an API using Flask hosted on a local server. The API takes in a request with a list of home attributes and returns an estimated price for that home.
